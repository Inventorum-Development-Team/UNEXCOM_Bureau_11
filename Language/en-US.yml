At first, they were highly violent but the last samples we were able to retrieve were in better condition. Perhaps the first ones were useless for their cause?

This allowed us to perform test on the substance. It began to decompose rather quickly, but we were able to identify some vague traces of genetic material of Earth origin, perphaps animal. We need to adquire another same to conduct additional more tests."

  STR_ALIEN_SAMPLE_FLASK_INTEL_3_UFOPEDIA: "Using the same method obtained before, we were able to open this flask as well. The tests ran on the red goo confirmed the presence of human DNA of at least 30 different individuals. All of them are reported as missing persons. This confirms the aliens are directly using us for their nefarious purposes."
  STR_ALIEN_SAMPLE_FLASK_MAJOR_REPORT: "Final Report: Alien Sample Flask"
  STR_ALIEN_SAMPLE_FLASK_MAJOR_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Our theory about the strange containers found inside the area where the abduction took place is they are some kind of 'energy drink' or nutrimental suppliment specifically for aliens. It contains human DNA samples and several other unknown additives, probably meant to be used to help the aliens become more human-like."

So, we have delegated the jurisdiction of the investigation (and hopefully, the recovery) of abducted victims to both the Bureau 11 branch of Area 51 and the FBI. They will take care of this with efficiency."

It is seperated into several Directorates, each with an individual speciality (external and counter intelligence, cryptography, VIP protection...etc), sixteen of which are numbered. This much we know of already. However, our agents have faced members of the mysterious 17th Directorate, which has been dedicated to investigating and collecting extraterrestrial artifacts. These goals are in conflict to ours, and they will actively try to prevent us from obtaining them. Worse news, Directorate 17 has several covert cells conducting operations in North America. We can send our U-2 spyplanes to locate them, however very blatant grabs for alien technology will be detected either way."

  STR_GLADIO_BRIEFING_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Us, allied intelligence agencies, and NATO have several contingencies in-place for countering Soviet invasion. Gladio is one such operation, a stay-behind operation based mostly in Italy, however it encompases most of Western Europe. In the event of a successful invasion by the Soviets, Gladio sleeper agents will become active. Thier membership draws largely from the mafia, and we have provided training and stockpiles of weapons. In order to facilitate thier operations, they have remained largely independent of us and hold no strong loyalties. As such, many in the CIA are fearful that Gladio is vulnerable to being compromised. While they will assist with driving the KGB D17 out of Europe, we will have to remain vigilant."

While we are primarily a reconnissance group, we have had violent encounters with foreign intelligences both extraterrestrial and eastward directional. These should help for mission where we must remain undetected or there are too many witnessess, especially in populated urban areas. Otherwise, they are relatively inferior to the rest of our arsenal."

  STR_ARMY_MUNITIONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Our aquisition of US Army munitions has been approved due to the rising scale of the alien incursions and violent encounters with the 17th Directorate.

  STR_ALLIED_MUNITIONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "We have obtained these weapons in the field and our agents have taken a liking to them, though they aren't produced in the US.

  STR_PROTOTYPE_MUNITIONS_REPORT: "Report: Prototype Munitions"
  STR_PROTOTYPE_MUNITIONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "These weapons have been reverse engineered from the samples of alien weaponry obtained in the field. Instead of using a removable battery like the aliens, these weapons are powered by an external battery included in the Augmentation Suit. This has the advantage of enabling the weapons to be lighter and more powerful, at the cost of requiring the agent to bring specialized equipment with the suit."
  STR_ALIEN_MUNITIONS_REPORT: "Report: Alien Munitions"
  STR_ALIEN_MUNITIONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "After thorough examiniation of the weapons wielded by the aliens and obtained by our agents, we have finally found out how to operate them. The basic principles are understood to us and most parts are analogous to ones we can produce, but the central reflective crystal has properties that cannot be replicated. The weapons shockingly resemble to ours in operation, similar to operating a magazine loading gun."
  STR_ALIEN_LASER_WEAPONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "After carefully analyzing the fragments found of the laser weapons used by the invaders, we have concluded that they employ a large miniaturized power source that emits radiation. In other words, a mini nuclear reactor for each weapon. The minerals that power the reactor and the crystal that power the effect of the light beam emitted by the power source are not found in the periodic table and we consider them highly exotic. This radiation is not enough to kill a human being on contact, but a prolonged exposure will seriously increase the risk of cancer and poisoning."
  STR_GLADIO_MUNITIONS_REPORT: "Report: Gladio Munitions"
  STR_GLADIO_MUNITIONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "The weapons Gladio use were stockpiled by the CIA and various other Western intelligence agencies.

It is powered by the rare material identified as 'Elerium' and it employs what be belive to be nuclear a nuclear reaction. however we have no idea how it is initiated. What we are sure, it emits a large gravitational field around it. If we manage to crack it's secrets, it will be the next transport revolution! We could easily transport large amounts of cargo and people across large distances in airplanes equipped with this power source. Perhaps one day..."
  STR_UFO_NAVIGATION: "Alien Navigation Device"
  STR_UFO_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "A quite abundant tech device found on all the alien craft. We theorize it may be a combination of navigational systems and comms station used to control the OETO and communicate with the alien equivalent of mission control, based on our investigations. Very interesting piece of technology, we don't have any practical use for it yet, but we are confident our research could find one."

We are completely sure there is an active extraterrestrial presence trying to invade our planet. The reason why they are so active in our country is not clear, but we belive they are targeting the United States because one of their crafts crashed in our soil back in '47. But we are sure on something: they will become more active. Less subtle, more aggressive. We'll need to deploy recon crafts and engage in air combat against the enemy craft if we want to prevent them to fully invade our country."

It appears to be an anti-materiel rifle, firing tungsten alloy slugs at ludicrous speeds."
