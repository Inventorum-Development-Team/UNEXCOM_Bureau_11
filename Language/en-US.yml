As their mysterious nature has been attributed to extraterrestrials, we dispatched agents to collect evidence at one such site. Flammable chemical residue invasive to the environment was found at the scene. We theorize that this chemical was used to initiate a controlled burn that engraved the pattern. These patterns may be created by aliens to signal OETOs flying over head, though of what we are still unsure. While we suspect these are alien in nature, we have no conclusive evidence."

  STR_BURNED_GROUND_INTEL_3_UFOPEDIA: "Our R&D team completed the analysis of the last delivered photograph of the research site. The result, compared to the information provided by the Geiger detectors, indicates that the soil burn was caused by an unknown operating tool, whose function is to cleanly cut organic and inorganic material. Whoever makes these circles employs high-tech tools."

  STR_BURNED_GROUND_MAJOR_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "We can just guess the intention of the creators of those strange circles found on crops and farmlands across the world. Is it some kind of signal?

This would indicate that they were cut apart by a high powered laser. Several key organs were missing. Our current theory is that the perpetrators abducted these cattle and removed certain organs that they needed. For what, however, we remain unsure.

  STR_CATTLE_CORPSE_INTEL_2_UFOPEDIA: "This corpse is in a better state than the previous one we have found.

  STR_CATTLE_CORPSE_MAJOR_REPORT: "Final Report: Cattle Corpse"
  STR_CATTLE_CORPSE_MAJOR_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "The outsiders are collecting organic samples from our planet. They have special interest in the cattle probably because it's easier to abduct and exact the organs and skin samples than a human, very likely due the large size.

  STR_CATTLE_BLOOD_INTEL_1: "Cattle Blood Intel I"

  STR_CATTLE_BLOOD_MAJOR_REPORT: "Final Report: Cattle Blood"
  STR_CATTLE_BLOOD_MAJOR_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Based on our previous studies, we came to the conclusion that the outsiders are draining the blood of farm cattle, most likely to feed themselves.

  STR_CATTLE_ORGANS_INTEL_1: "Cattle Organs Intel I"
  STR_CATTLE_ORGANS_INTEL_1_UFOPEDIA: "We have found what looks like the severed guts of an unknown living being. They are almost irreconocible, likely extracted by brute force.

  STR_CATTLE_ORGANS_INTEL_2: "Cattle Organs Intel II"
  STR_CATTLE_ORGANS_INTEL_2_UFOPEDIA: "A fresh sample has arrived. The purpose is yet unknown. However, we have found small bite-like lacerations over the surface of the organ. Was it bitter by someone? Was it ruptured with a tool? We don't know yet, but we do know the being who did this is actively looking for more organs. The forensic team thinks they can expand their research if we bring in another sample."
  STR_CATTLE_ORGANS_INTEL_3: "Cattle Organs Intel III"
  STR_CATTLE_ORGANS_INTEL_3_UFOPEDIA: "The last organ sample was in excellent condition. It looks so clean and perfectly preserved, almost as if it was meant to be used as a recipe ingredient of some sorts.

  STR_CATTLE_ORGANS_MAJOR_REPORT: "Final Report: Cattle Organs"
  STR_CATTLE_ORGANS_MAJOR_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "The methods of the invaders to obtain organ samples improved greatly over the course of the time. At first, they were highly violent but the last samples we were able to retrieve were in better condition. Perhaps the first ones were useless for their cause? Our staff theorize a foreign power is collecting DNA and tissue samples from cattle in order to create some kind of biological weapon, probably aimed at disrupting the Western food supply chains. Or even worse, experiments to create drugs for purposes yet unknown."

Some operations will require a more concealed approach, while in others we will have weapons free authorization."
  STR_VEHICLES_REPORT: "Vehicles"
  STR_VEHICLES_UFOPEDIA: "The nature of our mission both allows us and limits us to the use of transport crafts of diverse types. The most common is an uncovered deployment using public airlines, but if the situation gets grim, we can request our superiors for specialized transports. Also, we have access to aerial recon provided by Lookhed U-2 Dragon Lady spy crafts." 
  STR_AERIAL_RECON: "Aerial Recon"
  STR_AERIAL_RECON_UFOPEDIA: "The U-2 spy planes are used to get privileged access to intelligence otherwise impossible to obtain. Manned by USAF pilots working for the Agency, we can use the superior range and ability to get high resolution photos to find and identificate any potential invader activity or ground sites. Be especially careful in the deployment, though. The Soviets had already shot down an U-2 just a year before. Avoid entering the USSR as much as possible, they won't hesitate to launch Interceptors and SAMs."

However, it appears to be imperfect with some eerie features such as reptilian eyes. Reports from the field indicate that they exerted some sort of mental control over the troops. Perhaps this is to assist in the disguise, or to improve the creature's combat power. Nevertheless, this is a dangerous creature that should not be underestimated."

It mentioned us they use a relay of some kind to be able to retrive fallen crafts and their crew members, in case they were shot down by local forces or had an accident.

  STR_GOOD_ENDING_1: "The Havanna Beacon was destroyed in a huge explosion, seen kilometers away. The joint efforts of West and East powers resulted in a total victory. The last remaining aliens in Cuba were hunted down by the locals and their corpses kept as war trophies."
  STR_GOOD_ENDING_2: "The world knew a 'serious and unexpected incident in a chemical plant' deep within the island was the reason behind the explosion. The American naval quarantine around the island was lifted and Soviet troops were secretly evacuated back to home. A 'nuclear war was avoided with diplomacy', Kennedy said."
  STR_GOOD_ENDING_3: "But the American and Soviet leaders knew this wasn't the end. The aliens would surely come again. Maybe not tomorrow, not next year. But their return was a fact. Intelligence services on both sides of the Iron Curtain exchanged data collected on the Secret Crisis."
  STR_GOOD_ENDING_4: "Plans were made and designs for prototype weapons drew, both stored in secret vaults. Earth won a big advantage: the posibility of developing practical directed energy weapons, using the tech left behind by the invaders. It won't be easy to replicate it, but the results will worth the efforts."
  STR_GOOD_ENDING_5: "The most promising defense planning to defend Earth of a future invasion, is the Project Olympus. A huge spaceship powered by nuclear bombs could protect the planet's orbit and project power way beyond Mars. The fear of a nuclear escalation reduce this to a series of blueprints and promises of building them once the time comes. The only question is when. But we will be ready."
  STR_BAD_ENDING_FINAL_1: "We couldn't manage to destroy the Havana Beacon before it was fully complete. The light beam emanating from the pyramids became brighter, it could be seen from miles away. Soon after, hundreds of unknown signals appeared in the radars all over the Caribbean." 
  STR_BAD_ENDING_FINAL_2: "In fear of being overwhelmed, the US launched several tactical nukes directly to the Beacon, hoping to destroy it and the forces near it. Everything around the pyramids is vaporized, aliens and humans alike."
  STR_BAD_ENDING_FINAL_3: "But it's too late. An increasing number of alien craft started to pour down directly to the naval blockade around the isle, engaging the US Navy and severely crippling several ships. The swarm of OETOs quickly spread around the planet."
  STR_BAD_ENDING_FINAL_4: "In a matter of hours, all the World Powers launch their nukes at the aliens, even between each others. Large amounts of land become irradiated and what is left, became new territories for the invaders. Earth is a molten husk of it's former glory. The future is uncertain."
  STR_BAD_ENDING_MID_1: "Even with our best efforts, we couldn't prove the menace of the alien invasion... we couldn't stop it. Our warnings were ignored and our credibility lost. The Bureau was disbanded and our resources diverted to 'more important operations'."
  STR_BAD_ENDING_MID_2: "There were reports of a sudden 'pillar of light' somewhere the Caribbean and a lost of communications around the area. But then everything returned to usual."
  STR_BAD_ENDING_MID_3: "The reports of unknown beings walking within our societies became common. The rumors of alien Shapeshifters operating directly inside the world governments slowly spread... and eventually, they weren't just rumors."
  STR_BAD_ENDING_MID_4: "Soon after, the skies were full of alien crafts, landing on all the major urban centers. Humans were abducted by hundreds. No opposition was made, because the infiltrators made sure no one would be willing to defend themselves. Earth no longer belongs to us."
